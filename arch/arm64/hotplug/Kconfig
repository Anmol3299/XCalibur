	    as well as this is not a Load-Based HotPlug. Hence, this HotPlug is very
	    Efficient in terms of CPU and Battery Consumption. Moreover, as the
	    name indicates, this HotPlug provides absolute flexibility in terms
	    of usage. The users can put either of the two Clusters offline if they
	    want to. Also, users can create Dual, Quad and Hexa Core Combos for
	    more Efficiency and Better Performance.
